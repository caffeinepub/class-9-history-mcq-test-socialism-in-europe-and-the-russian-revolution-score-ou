  "summary": "Diff shows partial expansion of backend question population (questions numbered at least 1–10) and updates to project_state.json. Due to truncation and lack of visible getQuestions()/scoring code, none of the three explicit requirements can be verified as implemented from the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the backend MCQ question bank to include exactly 25 MCQs covering #russianEmpire, #februaryRevolution, and #afterFebruary with easy→medium→hard progression.",
      "reason": "The visible portion of backend/main.mo only shows questions 1–10 and only for #russianEmpire and #februaryRevolution; there is no evidence in the truncated diff that the bank contains exactly 25 questions, includes #afterFebruary questions, or that every MCQ has exactly 4 options and correctAnswerIndex in 0..3 across the full set.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure getQuestions() returns questions ordered easy→medium→hard with deterministic tie-break (stable order across calls).",
      "reason": "No getQuestions() implementation or explicit sorting/ordering logic is shown in the truncated backend/main.mo diff; therefore ordering and determinism cannot be confirmed.",

        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Update backend scoring so 25 questions still yield a maximum score of exactly 50 without hard-capping.",
      "reason": "No scoring function or scoring constants/logic are shown in the truncated backend/main.mo diff, so it cannot be verified that a perfect 25/25 yields 50 and 0/25 yields 0 via the scoring model itself.",

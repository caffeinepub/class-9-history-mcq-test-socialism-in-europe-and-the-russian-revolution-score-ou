      "requirement": "Backend method returns quiz questions without exposing correct answers to the client.",
      "reason": "The backend MCQ type includes `correctAnswerIndex`, and the frontend queries `actor.getQuestions()` as `MCQ[]`. There is no evidence (in the provided diff summary) of a separate client-safe question type or filtering/removal of correct answers in the questions payload.",

      "reason": "The diff summary shows frontend calling `actor.submitAnswers(answers)` and treating the result as a number, but the backend implementation of `submitAnswers` and any scaling to a score out of 50 is not shown in the provided truncated backend file excerpt.",
